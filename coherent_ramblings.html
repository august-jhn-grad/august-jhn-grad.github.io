                    Mathematical Structures
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Ever since taking <a href = "resources/classes/Foundations/foundations.html"> foundations </a> I became very troubled, yet very curious, about mathematical structure itself. To me
                    it seemed so mysterious that there would be some sort of invisible universe, which we could not control, and yet we could explore, which seemed detatched from
                    space, time and matter. Even stranger, it seemed to me as though we had ways of knowing about this part of the universe, yet without use of the senses.
                    I was deeply troubled, yet deeply fascinated. After taking a couple of philosohpy classes (philosophy of language and epistemology) I started to 
                    change my views a bit, but the intial impression of existential dread and wonder has never left me. I talk about this, albeit in the spirit of unbridled chaos which I try and contain in 
                    that section of my blog, <a href = "ramblings_of_a_lunatic.html#experiencing-math"> here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Philosophical inquiry into mathematics, in my regurgitated opinion from Saunders Mac Lane, ought to actually center around mathematics. After really enjoying the style of Saunders Mac Lane's book,
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics,_Form_and_Function"><i> Mathematics, Form and Function</i></a>, I wanted to structure my own personal learning in a similar format. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike the format of the above mentioned book, I wanted to focus especially on algebraic structures. I didn't just want to focus around any algebraic structures, but those which I have 
                    had particular run-ins with in the past. Some of the examples include groups, quandles, and racks, which I dealt with in my REU experience last summer (which was my first real taste of mathematical research). 
                    I wanted to learn the ways in which algebraic structures tie in with a wide variety of mathematical objects. This focus on concrete, famous, and visually appealing <b>objects</b> Hopefully
                    balances out any unnecessary abstraction, as well as illustrates where these structures actually come from, and why they are interesting.

                Here, I talk about cool mathematical thoughts which don't fit nicely into other parts of my blog, but for which I still want a place to talk about.
