        “...The name of the song is
        called “Haddock’s Eyes.”’<br>
        ‘Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?’Alice said, trying
        to feel interested.<br>
        ‘No, you don’t understand,’ the Knight said, looking a
        little vexed. <br>
        ‘That’s what the name is called. The name
        really is “The Aged Aged Man.”’<br>
        ‘Then I ought to have said “That’s what the song is
        called”?’ Alice corrected herself.<br>
        ‘No, you oughtn’t: that’s quite another thing! 
        <br>The song
        is called “Ways and Means”: but that’s only what it’s
        called, you know!’ “

            About a month ago, I was trying to understand a proof in a paper I was reading, and I just wasn’t getting anywhere. 
            The proof involved showing that a certain diagram commutes by proving that two specific elements of the inner automorphism 
            group of a quandle were the same (I’ll explain what some of this means in a moment). I manipulated the symbols as much as I
             could, nearly filling up a whole classroom’s worth of chalkboards with what turned out to be gibberish. I made lists of the 
             things I knew, trying to use the things on this list to put more things on the list, in hopes that something would finally click. 
             But it just wasn’t happening, so I wrote down my questions to ask our the REU mentor the following morning.

             <br>

            It turned out that the proof was “obvious.” But what does “obvious” mean? It often seems as though the most obvious things 
            in math are the hardest to grasp. In reflecting on why the proof was both hard and easy, our REU mentor quoted the above poem. 
            Then he remarked that the interesting proofs in math occur when semantics and syntax interact: when things and their names interact 
            (to put it probably incorrectly).


        You see, the problem was that I had gotten lost in the confusing land that lies between the name of a thing and the thing to which the name
         belongs: the line between a word and it’s meaning, a meaning and its thing. To see what I mean, I will have to give you the words by which
          I mean what I mean. 

        The first of these names is “automorphism.” An automorphism is a change that can be made to a thing while preserving what the thing most 
        fundamentally is. It is a function, from a thing to itself, which scrambles a thing while preserving what it is, its essence if you like.
         It is perhaps best to move on the next name, for then we can explain it, and it’s explanation will further explain the meaning of the 
         word “automorphism” by providing an example. The second name is “quandle.” A quandle is a set, equipped with an operation satisfying 
         certain requirements… blablabla… You need not know any more than that what a specific quandle is, is a function of it’s elements, 
         and the ways in which those elements act on each other via the operation, and restricted to certain rules. (what are those certain 
         rules? I won’t tell you, and the strange thing is that it won’t affect anything about this reflection: an observation worthy of
          reflection!) So what is an automorphism on a quandle? You guessed it, it is a function, from a quandle to itself, which keeps the 
          elements, and also the ways by which they interact with each other under the operation, all the while losing nothing about the quandle’s
           essence. You’ll notice how little of what’s written here actually matters. That’s the point, I think.

           <br>
        So what is a quandle automorphism. Well, it is what it does to the quandle. So how do you prove that two of them are the same? 
        By showing that what they do to the quandle is the same. It turned out that in order to show that the two specific automorphisms
         which had me stumped were the same, I would have to think, not about their names, but about their essence. In this case, their 
         essence is their action upon the quandle. Just as with any two things, the way you go about showing that they are the same is by
          showing that their essences agrees. The names are merely tags which we attach to things, but the things themselves are distinct
           from their names. Sometimes you can use rules about how their names relate to show that they are the same. This is algebra. But
            sometimes you can’t just do that, in which case you have to think about what the things actually are. Sometimes you have to do
             both. In this case, you have to think about what the automorphisms do to the quandle, as well as what the names are and how 
             they relate. Only then can you show they are the same. AHH HELP!!!<br>

        …<br>
        I think the reader, and the writer, should both take a break, ignoring most of the above content
        …<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Personally, I think that much of the difficulty of math comes from this dilemma: that names of things and things of names get scrambled.<br>
         It’s often hard to say what a thing is in math, because things in math lack concrete objects to attach to them. A thing in math is made<br>
          of names, not stuff, but the things in math need names. Of course, the names we give to those things make things, and we must name them<br>
          . When thinking about things in math, you have to traverse this confusing mess of names of things and things of names. This hard, and<br>
           I believe that is part of why math is hard.
