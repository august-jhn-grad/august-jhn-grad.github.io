  <h1>
    Experiencing Math
</h1>
  
    <div class = "content">


      
        How do you experience mathematics? It’s an interesting question, and it’s answer has probably evolved much in your life. It certainly has for me. 
        Personally, I think it’s an interesting point of reflection on my own mathematical journey. Hopefully whoever is brave enough to read the nonsense 
        of this dark and chaotic corner of my blog will be inspired to make similar reflections. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think that your average person would fall into two categories in terms of their mathematical experience, and I have at many times belonged to both. 
        Some experience math as a humiliating and traumatic experience. They find it difficult to memorize their multiplication tables, and find themselves 
        struggling to pull off impossible tasks, slowly and painfully, only to stave off the scorn of their peers and teachers. This was how I originally 
        experienced math. I struggled immensely to learn “basic” arithmetic, and spent years in the resource room trying over and over again to master long division.
         I got it eventually, sort of, but even today I struggle with arithmetic, as any of the folks I tutor could attest to.

        Some people seem to excel at picking up this or that concept in math, and enjoy the application of it for obvious reasons.
         I’d imagine that whatever we’re good at, we enjoy it. Many of my peers fell into this category in their early childhood.
          They were math wizzes, who picked up multiplication like lightening. Some of them competed in math competitions.
           This was pretty much the opposite of my experience of grade school math, but I found myself in this category once numbers left and symbols entered. 
           I started to enjoy high school algebra and calculus simply because I felt like I was good at it. But then came linear algebra, and I struggled once again.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every once in a while I experienced math in ways other than these. I’ll call these experiences “transcendent” moments, where I felt as though math was something bigger than myself, 
        and perhaps bigger than the physical universe. I remember a brief (and crude) unit on proofs in geometry, where I felt as though each supposition brought us into a different world, 
        which had existed for all eternity. In my young mind, it felt as though these were little worlds, which I could pop into just be making a supposition. I was amazed by such a process, 
        and began to feel as though the collection of all of these little worlds made up one big universe, and that the world I inhabited was just one of these, though much more complicated
         than the ones we “supposing” our way into.

         <br>
         <br>
  
        I think that there are problems with such a simple view, but it is still beautiful and inspiring, and it’s impression has never left me. It developed further in Foundations my freshman year,
         and I began to feel as though the world of suppositions and consequences was what constituted reality, and that we could navigate and explore this reality by supposing our way around.
          Supposition, in my mind then, was a space ship, a vehicle for traversing the multiverse. As a cartoonish illustration of my vision at the time, imagine the scene from the first (if only it were the only) Dr. Strange movie,
           where the Ancient One shoves the protagonist on a tour through the multiverse. Instead of the line “open your eyes” I heard “Suppose x \in A.”
  
          <br>
          <br>
        My vision of “worlds of suppositions and consequences” evolved into a vision of a “worlds of algebraic structure,” much through number theory and intro to python. 
        n number theory I learned the properties of the natural numbers, and the ways in which the natural numbers’ embedding into a larger algebraic system (such as the integers,
         Gaussian integers, or Hurwitz integers) could provide novel information about the natural numbers themselves. I was struck by such a process, in much the same way as I was amazed by the process of “supposing”.
          This impression developed even further during my Junior year, when I took philosophy of language, algebra, complex analysis, general relativity, quantum mechanics, topology, as well as read Godel Escher Bach.
           This impression began to evolve into my personal explanation for most things. What is time? It is it’s own image through a collection of structure preserving maps. What is a number? It is it’s structure. 
           What is reality? The world of structure. Once again, I don’t think that such a simple view has any direct merit, and it is at best an over-romanticized introduction to a textbook on category theory. 
           The reason I recall it now is that it has since colored my experience of mathematics. I became fascinated and mesmerized with “structure.”

           <br>
        Finally, my REU experience shook the way I experience mathematics to the very foundation. I became aware of the creative aspect of mathematics, of the power of definitions. Each definition I made felt like a good strike to a piece of marble. 
        As a stone mason chisels a piece of stone through his or her tools: the chisel and mallet, I began to feel like that I, as an aspiring mathematician, used the tools in my belt to chisel away at mathematical ideas, to shape the shapeless.
         But at the same time, the great paradox remained: I had little control over the end result. The marble I was chiseling, so to speak, had a life of its own. 
         It felt that my creative strokes did nothing other than reveal the qualities and thoughts of the stone, which had been there long before me.

        Meanwhile, my REU advisor, as a category theorist, topological quantum field theorist, topologist, and logician, made me aware of many strange concepts and issues.
         The problem of construction versus existence, of syntax and semantics, and many others, created a sense of existential dread about the nature of math. 
         I have since carried this with me. He instilled in me a sort of skeptical attitude, where I grapple with infinite sets, existence proofs, and the like, not rejecting them,
          but grappling with them. This has led to a much richer experience of real analysis. It’s inspired me to read about the different ways of constructing the reals 
          (dedekind cuts, the three big axioms, and geometry), of the historical controversies, and of the isomorphism between every totally ordered field which satisfies the upper bound axiom!

        So what’s my point? My point is that my experience of mathematics has evolved much over time. It went from being a traumatic and humiliating experience, to “my thing”, to a journey through
         an infinite universe of suppositions of consequences, to a forest of forms and structures, to an art project, to existential dread. I wonder what other epochs of mathematical experience lie before me.
        Anyway, my point is that I have experienced math in many different ways throughout my life. It’s interesting to reflect upon. Moreover, I think that a mathematics education which focuses on the student’s 
        experience more than their knowledge, is a thing to be strived for. If anything, I reckon that a bit of attention to the way we all experience math would benefit both the way we learn it, and the way we teach it.
