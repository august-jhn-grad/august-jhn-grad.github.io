            <p>
                I really enjoyed this class. It allowed me to reflect on many interesting ideas. The real numbers are far more troubling than they seem.
                I would say I am agnostic about them. This class was also really fun because it has so many interesting connections to topology. The proofs
                are absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend.

                Unfortunately, many of my hand-written preperations for class presentations are lost to time. Still, the spirit of the class still lives in my typed up proofs.
