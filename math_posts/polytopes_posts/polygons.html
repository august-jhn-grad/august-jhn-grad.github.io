        Polygons are polytopes in two dimensions. The vertex and the line segment are the zero and one dimensional poltyopes. For reasons, 
        the -1 dimensional polytope is the emptyset. This is so boring that it is pretty much just by convention. The only proper beginning
        to a story about polytopes is with polygons, with the focus on regular polygons. That being said, non-regular polygons are interesting,
        especially for their triangulations. We'll start with a definition.

        <b>Definition.</b> A polygon \(\Pi = [p_0,\dots, p_{n-1}]\) is a finite collection of points, connected by edges \(\overline{p_i,\dots, p_{(i+1)\mod n}}\). 
        We say that \(\Pi\) is equilateral if all of its edges are equal. We say that \(\Pi\) is regular if all the angles of the form \(\angle p_ip_{(i+1)\mod n}p_{(i+2)\mod n}\) are equal.

        It's easy to see that interior angles of a regular \(p\)-gon are \((1-\frac{2}{p})\pi\). Since every regular polygon is of length Let \(O\) be the center of the regular polygon. To see this, we consider a triangle
