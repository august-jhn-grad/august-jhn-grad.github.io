    <h1>Isometries</h1>
    <p>

        We start by defining the Euclidean plane. For us, the Euclidean plane is a particular metric space. It is a particular set, 
        with a particular distance function on that set.

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Definition. </b>
        The Euclidean plane is the set \(\mathbb{R}^n\), endowed with the metric \(d\), which is defined for 
        any two points \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\dots, p_n), \mathbf{q} = (q_1,\dots, q_n), \) as 
        \[d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2}.\]
        This metric space is denoted as \(\mathbb{E}^n = (\mathbb{R}^n , d).\)

        <br>
        <br>

        Since the underlying set of Euclidean space is a cartesian product, we can also view Euclidean space as a vector space. Every 
        point of Euclidean space is some linear combination of the standard basis vectors \(\mathbf{e}_i\)

        \[
        \mathbf{p} = \sum_{i = 1}^n\mathbf{e}_i
        \]

        A morphism of metric spaces is, you guessed it, a distance preserving map from one space to another. That is,
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Definition. </b>
        Let \((X, d_X)\) and \((Y, d_Y)\) be metric spaces. An isometry is a function \(f: X\to Y\) such that for any points \(p,q\in X\),
        \[d_X(p,q) = d_Y(f(p), f(q)).\] An automorphism \(\alpha:X\to X\) is a bijective isometry whose inverse is an isometry. That is, an automorphism 
        of a metric space is an isomorphism \(X\cong X\). As always, the automorphisms form a group. This group is denoted \(\mathbf{Aut}(X)\). 
        <br>
        <br>

        The automorphism group of a metric space tells you much about the space. The isometry group is such a valuable theoretical tool that 
        towards the turn of the century, mathematicians such as Felix Klein suggested that geometry ought to center around the 
        study of such groups. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The group \(\mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{E}^n)\), for some natural number \(n\), is massive, and rich in structure. I like to think of it as a metropolis of groups, since within each euclidean isometry group 
        lives a great population of other familiar groups. In fact, we'll show that <b>every</b> finite group appears as a subgroup of some euclidean group!
         The Euclidean group is not just a group: it is a topological group and a Lie group. 
        We will always study this group in relation to the obvious action of \(\mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{E}^n) \) on the plane. An interesting yet obvious result about the structure of any isometry group will soon be obvious.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Proposition </b> For any natural numbers \(n \le m\), there is a natural inclusion 
        \[\mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{E}^n) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{E}^m)\]
        
        <br>
        <br>
        First, we should define a reflection through the origin and a translation. I will take the analytic approach to geometry. My analysis of the Euclidean group, and the Euclidean plane, will rely heavily on coordinate systems and algebraic manipulations.
        This will have the benefit of making some things easier to explicitly compute and visualize. 

        <br>

        <b>Definition. </b> Given a dimension \(n\), a square \(n\times n\) matrix acts on \(\mathbb{E}^n\)
