    <h1>Groups and Other Mathematical Objects</h1>

    <p>

        We would do well not to over-romanticize category theory from the start. Categories are, on their own, not that interesting. The power of the concept,
        even if only as a stepping stone to other concepts, is through the idea of <b>functors</b>, and mappings between functors called <b>natural transformations</b>.
        These concepts allow one to treat categories in their own right as mathematical objects, just as group theory allows one to view groups as their own mathematical object. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Definition. </b> Let \(\mathcal{C} = (\mathcal{O}, \mathbf{hom}, \mathbf{cod}, \mathbf{codom}, \circ, \mathbf{1}\) and \(\mathcal{C}\) be categories. A functor \(\mathcal{F} = (F_\mathcal{O},F_\mathbf{hom})\) 
        is a pair of mappings \(F_\mathcal{O} : \)

        <br>
        <br>
        Not every important association between categories is naturally a functor. For example, the association which led us to talk about categories in the first place, \(\mathbf{Aut}\) is not naturally functorial.
        That said, you could make it <b>unnaturally</b> functorial by taking every arrow in \(\mathcal{C}\) \(A\to B\) to the arrow \(\alpha\in \mathbf{Aut}(A)\mapsto 1_B\in \mathbf{Aut}(B)\). 
        I leave it to you to decide whether or not this is an interesting construction (it isn't). The point is, even if you <b>could</b> regard \(\mathbf{Aut}\) as a functor, the question remains,
        would it lead to any greater insight? I think not. Nonetheless, the association \(\mathbf{Aut}\) will make it's appearence all over the place, for example, in the next section on <b>symmetric groups</b>.
        As a preview, we have:
        <ul>
            <li>
                \(S_n = \mathbf{Aut}(\mathbf{n})\) for a finite set \(\mathbf{n} = \{1,\dots, n\}\in \mathbf{Set_f}\), called the <b>symmetric group on \(n\) letters,</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\mathbf{Aut}(G)\) for a group \(G\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(GL(V) = \mathbf{Aut}(V)\) for a vector space \(V\) over a given field (this actually does turn out to be naturally functorial),
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\mathbf{Aut}(X)\) for a given metric space, and where the arrows are isometries. For example, we'll explore the isometries of the Euclidean plane, and it's finite subgroups, and more generally it's discrete subgroups.
                This will allow us to classify regular polytopes, regular tesselations of the plane and higher dimensional analogues, as well as "euclidean manifolds". 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>

        Some of the associations with groups which <b>are</b> functors, and which are interesting to us, are
        <ul>
            <li>
                the forgetful functor \(\mathcal{U} : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Set}\) which maps \((G,\cdot)\in \mathbf{Grp}\to G\in \mathbf{Set}\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\pi_1:\mathbf{PCTop}\to \mathbf{Grp} \) from path-connected topological spaces to groups. 
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                the inner automorphism group of a rack, \(\mathbf{Inn}:\mathbf{Rack}\to \mathbf{Grp}\), which it turns out is unique to the rack structure, and closely related to
            </li>
            <li>
                the inner automorphism group of a group, \(\mathbf{Inn}:\mathbf{Grp}\to \mathbf{Grp}\)
            </li>
            <li>
                the <a href = "Quandles.html">quandle</a> of group conjugation, \(\mathbf{Conj}:\mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Quand}\)
            </li>
        </ul>
