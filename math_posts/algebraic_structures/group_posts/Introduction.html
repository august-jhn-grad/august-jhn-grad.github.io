    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        The problem with abstract ideas is that they often feel useless and boring. Group theory is especially this way, at least to me.
        Sometime the results of group theory, at least those learned in my classes, seem obvious and hardly worth saying. Even for those 
        theorems which are non-obvious, it is often difficult to see why I would care about them. Groups don't seem powerful if introduced
        in a way that is disconnected from how they arose. Every abstraction has a beginning that is not abstract. Groups are no exception.<br>
        <br>

        Earlier this year I set out to find examples of the power of group theory. This has lead me to learn about a number of different fascinating topics.
        In the realm of geometry, my inquiry has lead me to learn about uniform polytopes and their symmetry groups. I've learned about Coxeter groups, and 
        their geometric realizations as Kaleidescopes. I've learned about the classification of all Coxeter groups. I've learned about Wythoff constructions;
        about methods of taking a Coxeter group and building the polytope from it. My desire to learn how to actually <b> compute </b> polytopes has lead me to
        learn about the Todd Coxeter algorithm. It has also forced me to refresh on some of the things which came up in my REU relating to the word problem of groups.

        <br>
        In the realm of topology, I've been learning about the fundamental group, about the knot group (which, it turns out, is the fundamental group of the knot complement in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)), and about
        the applications of the fundamental group to a number of areas in topology, algebra, knot theory, and, well group theory! I've learned that, through the use
        of graphs and their fundamental groups, a proof that the subgroups of the free group are all free is achievable! What's more, I've learned that this is
        pretty much the only easy way to prove this! I hope to go through the proof in greater depth, and I hope that my blog series will allow me to do just that.

        It may be said, whether correctly or not, that mathematical power is best demonstrated through computation and classification. Groups, it turns out, are powerful
        in both ways! They can be used as a computational tool, especially in computing the vertices and lattice structure of
        certain special classes of polytopes. They can be used to classify such polytopes, to distinguish between and understand various topological spaces, 
        and to classify all connected, complete, euclidean spaces. This only scratches the surface of the power of group theory.

        <br>
        <br>
        The purpose of this section of my blog is to explore the power of group theory, especially in geometry. I hope to share this exploration with whoever reads this,
        and to organize my inquiry through writing.
