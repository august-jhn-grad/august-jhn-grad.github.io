    <h1>Permutations, Set-groups, and Cayley's Theorem</h1>

    <p>
        Group action is one of the most important uses of group theory. 

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Definition. </b> Let \(G\) be a group, let \(S\) be a set. Then a (left) <b>action</b> of \(G\) on \(A\) is a map 
        \[\alpha:S\times G \to S,  \]
        which satisfies for any \(g,h\in G, s\in S\)
        <ul>
            <li>\(\alpha(s,1) = s\)</li>
            <li>\(\alpha(\alpha(s,g),h) = \alpha(s,gh)\)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        An easy consequence of this definition is that the maps \(\alpha(\_, g):S\to S\) are bijections. To see this, we need only 
        find a left and right inverse. Well, by the first second of the rules which defines actions, and by the very definition of a group (and the existence of a left and right multiplicative inverse \(g^{-1})\),
        the map \(\alpha(\_,g^{-1})\) must be a left and right inverse:

        \[\alpha(\alpha(s,g),g^{-1})\ = \alpha(s, gg^{-1}) = \alpha(s,1) = s\]

        In other words, \(\alpha(\_, g)\in \mathbf{Aut}(G)\). Since the automorphism group of a set is the symmetric group, 
        the action of a group on a 
        
        As a consequence, the map \(h:G\to \mathbf{Aut}(G)\)
