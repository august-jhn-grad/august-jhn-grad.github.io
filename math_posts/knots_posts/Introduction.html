    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        A knot is an <b>embeding</b> of the circle \(\mathbb{S}^1\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\). While each of these embedings are homeomorphic to each other, they can take on a variety of different shapes.
        
        For example, the trivial knot, which could be parametrized as \((cos\theta, \sin\theta), \theta \in [0,2\pi]\). (note that the 3d model of a knot is thickened so as to make it look nice. In reality, knots don't have any girth, and are a 1D object.)

            <p>Another famous and simple type of knot is called the trefoil knot:</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            
    <p>There is also it's mirror image: </p>
            <br>

    <p>Can you tell the difference? Is there a difference? What would it mean for there to a difference? This is the domain of knot theory, in which 
        these questions find a definate meaning, and a definite answer.

        <br>
        <br>
        Other questions pertaining to knot theory are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                When are two knots the same?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does one prove two knots are the same?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does one represent a knot? (combinatorially, algebraically...)
            </li>
            <li>
                How does one distinguish between knots?
            </li>
            <li>
                Under a reasonable definition of uniqueness, how many knots are there?
            </li>
        </ul>

        We'll explore and find answers to all of these questions, making some remarkable connections to quandles, groups, and racks along the way!
