        I intend for this blog series to be an exploration that persists for several years. It is one aspect of a larger attempt to reflect on the ways in which
        geometric problems give rise to algebraic structures. More broadly, this is part of my personal journey of inquiry into the very nature of mathematics itself.

        Kurt Reidemeister had the brilliance of turning knot theory into combinatorics. In the early 30's, he published a <a href = "https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/reidemeister_eng.pdf">book</a> 
        in which he proved the famous theorem theorem which some call "Reidemeister's Theorem." The theorem is with reference to a particular representation of a knot as a distinct mathematical object, called a knot diagram. 
        He proved that a certain equivalence on knot diagrams, induced by a set of combinatorial moves called "Reidemeister moves", is in fact equivalent to equivalence of knots. All of this will be defined in due time.
        But for now, I actually want to postpone all of this for later. This is for both dramatic effect, and for the purpose of illustrating the geometric nature of certain algebraic constructions.

        The first construction is the fundamental group of the knot compliment, denoted \(\pi_1(K)\). This, it can be proved, is fact equivalent to the knot group, which can be defined combinatorially.
        But it can be defined, and used, albeit with some difficulty, without reference to knot diagrams, and purely through topology. I think the beauty of such results is best expressed in this way.

        Similarly, the <b>knot quandle</b>, denoted \(Q(K)\), was originally defined by David Joyce in his classic paper (which is an absolute masterpiece). 
        Dr. Joyce's construction of the knot quandle was combinatorial, making reference to knot diagrams and Reidemeister moves. I want to postpone this for latter.
        At around the same time, Dr. Matveev, in another classic paper, associated another quandle with a knot \(K\). This association was defined entirely in terms of 
        geometry, and does not rely on Reidemeister moves or knot diagrams.

        <br>
        <br>
        Remarkably, the knot quandle is closely related to the knot group! This relationship need not reference knot diagrams and Reidemeister moves.
