        Abstracting Infinity: Part I
    </h1>
    
    <div class = "content">

        This post is an experiment in mathematical abstraction. My ideas here may not be correct. My terminology is most certainly not standard. I urge the reader to 
        read with the same playful and careless attitude with which I write. After all, this is literally a shower thought which I decided to formalize.

        <br>
        <br>

        Sets are a particularly interesting category, and for many reasons. One such reason is the sheer number of equivalent descriptions of infiniteness. I want to explore the 
        ways in which these descriptions diverge when abstracted into other categories such as groups, topological spaces, and categories in general.

        Let's suppose that the natural numbers exist, \(\mathbb{N}\in \mathbf{Set}\), with some initial element \(0\in \mathbb{N}\), and that there is a successor map \(\sigma:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\), and that induction works as it should.
        I propose using this set to define infinity.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Definition. </b> A set \(S\) is <b>infinite</b> if there exists an injection \(\mathbb{N}\to S\). 

        <br>
        <br>

        Obviously, by this definition, the natural numbers are infinite. In this post, the above definition is what "infinite" means. This definition is one among a number of possible alternatives. I list them here, and claim they are equivalent.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Theorem</b> The following are equivalent for a set \(S\)
        <ul>
            <li>\(S\) is infinite</li>
            <li> There exists some injection \(S\rightarrowtail S\) which is not a bijection. </li>
            <li> There exists a surjection \(S\rightarrowtail S\) which is not an injection. </li>
            <li> \(S\) properly contains an isomorphic copy of itself.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Proof</b> 
        It's probably easiest to start by proving the equivalence of the first two conditions. First, let \(S\) be inifinite. Then there is some injection \(i:\mathbb{N} \to S\). Notice that the successor map \(\sigma\) is itself an 
      injection but not a surjection (it misses \(0\)). Consider the composition \(i\sigma :\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\to S\). Clearly \(i\sigma\) is 
        an injection. Also, \(0\not\in \sigma(\mathbb{N})\). I claim \(i(0)\not\in i\sigma(\mathbb{N})\). For suppose it were. Then \(i(0) = i\sigma(n)\) for some \(n\in \mathbb{N}\). By injectivity,
        \(0 = \sigma(n)\), which is a contradiction (since \(\sigma\) is the successor map and \(0\) is the initial element). Therefore \(i(0) \not\in i\sigma(\mathbb{N})\), and \(i\sigma\) is not a surjection.

        <br>
        <br>

        Now suppose that there exists an injection \(f:S\rightarrowtail S\) which is not a surjection. Then there is some element \(x\in S\) which was missed by \(f\). I claim the map 
        \(s: \mathbb{N}\to S\) defined \(n \mapsto f^n(x)\) where \(f^0 = 1_S\). For suppose we had \(s(n) = s(m)\), such that \(m \ne n\). Without loss of generality, suppose \(n >m\). 
        Since \(n > m\), we can continually apply injectivity of \(f\), a finite number of times, to obtain 
        \[x = f^{n-m}(x) = f^{n-m-1}(f(x)),\]
        so \(x\) was not missed by \(f\): a contradiction. Therefore \(s : \mathbb{N} \rightarrowtail S\) is injective as desired.

        <br>
        <br>
        The second and third conditions are obviously equivalent.

        <br>
        <br>
        To show that the last condition is equivalent to the rest, first suppose that \(S'\subset S\) is a proper subset. Then the inclusion \(S'\hookrightarrow S\) is an injection which is not a surjection.  
        Now suppose that there is an injection which is not a surjection, \(i:S\rightarrowtail S\). Then the image set \(i(S) = \{x\in S: x = i(x') \exists x'\in S\}\) is a proper subset of S. 
        Clearly the constriction of \(i\) to \(i(S)\) is still injective, let's denote it by \(i'\). By construction, \(i'\) is a surjection as well. So we have a bijection \(i' : S\cong i(S)\).  

        <br>
        <b>Q.E.D.</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        In the category \(\mathbf{Set}\), we could have defined a set to be infinite when there exists some injection onto itself which is not surjective. In \(\mathbf{Set}\), the monomorphisms are 
        the injective maps, and the epimorphisms are the surjective maps. To explore the ways in which this definition of inifnity might 
        abstract to other categories, I propose the following definition. 

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Definition. </b> Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a category (it need not be concrete). An object \(A\) in \(\mathcal{C}\) is \(\mathcal{C}\)-infinite if and only if 
        there exists an monomorphism \(f:A\to A\) which is not an epimorphism. 

        <br>
        <br>
        This definition extends even to non-concrete categories. For ease of reference, let us call a morphism <i>proper</i> if there it is epi but not monic, or the other way around. If I put a line through an arrow, I mean to say it is proper. Therefore, 
        by definition of an epimorphism and a monomorphism, an object is \(\mathcal{C}\)-infinite if there is a proper sequence \(A\rightarrowtail A\twoheadrightarrow A\) such that the diagram commutes:
        
        <object data = "diagrams/figure.svg" width = "800px" height = "800px"></object>
    
        
        For concrete categories, this definition doesn't always play nicely with the underlying set functor. My first example of this phenomenon is in the category of abelian groups,

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Example. </b> Let \(p_i\) denote the i-th prime number. In \(\mathbf{AbGrp}\), the infinite abelian group

        \[A = \bigoplus_{n\in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z}/p_n\mathbb{Z}\]
        is not \(\mathbf{AbGrp}\)-infinite. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Proof. </b> Suppose that there is some homomorphism \(\phi: A\to A\) which is a monomorphism yet not an epimorphism. Since \(\phi\) is not a monomorphism, There 
        is some element \(\mathbf{\alpha} = (\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_n, \dots)\) such that \(\mathbf{\alpha} \not\in \phi(A)\). Since, by definition of the direct sum, there are only a finite number of 
        non-zero terms, which have indices \(i_1,\dots, i_k\). Clearly, since we are dealing with primes, each term is relaively prime. Therefore we have 
        \[o(<\alpha>) = \prod_{j = 1}^{k}p_{i_j} = N. \]

        I claim that the subgroup \(\phi(A)\le A\) has no subgroup of order \(N\). For suppose it did. Then 

        <br>
        <br>

        There are categories which are not naturally concrete, and in which no objects are infinite. Any groupoid provides an example. 

        <br>
        <br>
        As a preview for Part II of this post, I pose the following question. Does there exist some \(\mathbf{AbGrp}\)-infinity determining set like the natural numbers in abelian groups? More precicely,
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Question. </b>is there an abelian group 
        \(\mathbb{A}\) such that, for any abelian group \(A'\), there is a sequence \[\mathbb{A}\rightarrowtail A' \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{A} \] if and only if there is a proper sequence 
        \[A'\rightarrowtail A' \twoheadrightarrow A' ? \]
        Hint: I don't think so.
