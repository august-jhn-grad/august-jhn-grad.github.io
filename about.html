Welcome to my website. It is intentionally simple, and "intentionally" poorly designed. 
<br>
I am a math major at Willamette, and hopefully soon to be off to pursuing a PhD in math. 
<br>

I am a lover of mathematics,
<br>
of ancient Chinese language and poetry, 
<br>
of walks, of the cold, 
<br>
of coffee and mornings, 
<br>
of water and ice, 
<br>
of oceans and dark skies, 
<br>
of beer, 
<br>
of foggy forests and mountains,
<br>
of symmetry,
<br>
of loops and reflections and shadows and projections.
<br>
I love words and riddles and thoughts passing and profound,
<br>
of grammatically interesting and incorrect sentences,
<br>
of stars and lights, and the roots of polynomails.
<br>
Also my favorite Lord of the Rings character is Tom Bombadil
